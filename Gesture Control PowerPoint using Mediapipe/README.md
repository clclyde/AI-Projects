This project is a modified version of the [Original Project Repository](https://github.com/kinivi/hand-gesture-recognition-mediapipe). For detailed instructions and documentation, please refer to the source repository.

In this version, the main goal is to create a gesture-controlled PowerPoint presentation system. The original model has been retrained to recognize two specific right-hand gestures:

(1) Swipe Left ‚Äì to go forward one slide

(2) Swipe Right ‚Äì to go back one slide

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This version only works with the right hand.

üíª How to Run:
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the command: python app.py
3. Open the included Demo PPT to test slide navigation.
    Swipe right to left to go to the next slide.
    Swipe left to right to go to the previous slide.
    This configuration is chosen to simulate book flipping.
