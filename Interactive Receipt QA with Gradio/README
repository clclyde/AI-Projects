This is an modified version of one of the projects in this repository named the "Receipt Reader using Gradio." In this version, PaddleOCR is combined with 
Gemini API tomake a Gradio app that scans and analyzes a user-uploaded receipt. Thiss version also has a chatbot wherein the user can ask questions about 
the current uploaded receipt (e.g. what is the store name, what is the total bill, what is the mode of payment, etc.). 

To run the gradio app, open the file main.ipynb, preferably on Google Colab. Run all code blocks until the last one and click the link displayed after 
running the final code block.
