This is a modified version of a project from this repository titled "Receipt Reader using Gradio."
In this version, PaddleOCR is integrated with the Gemini API to create a Gradio app that scans and analyzes a user-uploaded receipt.

It also includes a chatbot that allows users to ask questions about the uploaded receipt (e.g., What is the store name? What is the total 
bill? What is the mode of payment?, etc.).

🚀 How to Run the App:
To run the Gradio app:
1. Open the file main.ipynb (preferably in Google Colab).
2. Run all the code cells sequentially.
3. At the third code block, you will need to insert your Google API key in one of the lines. If you don't have one yet, you can get one at https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey 
4. After the final cell, click the public Gradio link that appears to launch the app.
