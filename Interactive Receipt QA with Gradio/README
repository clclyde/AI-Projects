This is a modified version of a project from this repository titled "Receipt Reader using Gradio."
In this version, PaddleOCR is integrated with the Gemini API to create a Gradio app that scans and analyzes a user-uploaded receipt.

It also includes a chatbot that allows users to ask questions about the uploaded receipt (e.g., What is the store name? What is the total 
bill? What is the mode of payment?, etc.).

ðŸš€ How to Run the App:
To run the Gradio app:
1. Open the file main.ipynb (preferably in Google Colab).
2. Run all the code cells sequentially.
3. In the third code block, youâ€™ll need to insert your Google API key.
   If you donâ€™t have one yet, you can generate it at: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
4. After the final cell, click the public Gradio link that appears to launch the app.
